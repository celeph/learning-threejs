# Learning Three.js

## Introduction

This is a collection of Three.js examples, learning and practice projects.

At this time it includes 32 examples based on Bruno Simon's (excellent) course [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) I completed a little while ago.

I will continue to add more code based on his and other courses as well as my own experiments.

The purpose of this archive is to keep a reference handy in case I need a refresher on a certain 
feature or approach. 

It also serves a secondary purpose as a learning diary, to keep track of my progress and how 
techniques and features evolve over time. That's why each example is numbered. Maybe one day when 
I add example #999 to this repo, I'll have achieved mastery in Three.js :)

The examples all work as of today's initial commit (May 29, 2023), using npm 8.5.0, node 17.5.0,
webpack 5.1.3, webpack-cli 4.9.1, and webpack-dev-server 3.11.0.

## Installation and Usage

Pick a demo folder, install packages with

  `npm install`
  
To build a production bundle:

  `npm run build`
  
To run a local dev-server:

  `npm run dev`
  
and open http://localhost:8080.

The only exception is #001 - it's not setup for webpack, and it's so basic it doesn't need any packages.

## Summary

  - 001-032 based on Bruno Simon's course: [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/)
